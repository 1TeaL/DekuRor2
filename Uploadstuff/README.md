## Latest Changelog, Next update(s)

- 5.0.1- Fixes
    - Delaware smash release animation now plays
- 5.0.0- Deku Final Form Rework! SOTS Patch!
- Changes/Rework
    - Most if not all skills have been reworked and changed
    - Plus Ultra meter has been reworked:
    	- Deku now gains it at a set rate and when attacking enemies, the rate is doubled
     	- It is now split into 3 bars, and Deku's specials cost 1, 2 or 3 bars based on a neutral, backward or forward directional input.
      	- If Deku does not have enough bars, he can still use the special at an exponentially increasing cost of health for each missing bar.
        - When Deku switches modes, if he has atleast 1 bar, he will spend it for a Mode Switch attack with additional bonuses.
      	- Deku still can Go Beyond! when at max meter and takes a fatal hit.
    - Deku no longer has his old One For All special. Instead, at levels 10 and 20 he gains enhanced and mastered versions of his skills indicating his mastery over OFA. 
    - The overall aim of this rework is to streamline some of his clunkyness with the OFA special switching. It also aims to give deku a more coherent moveset, previously it was all about just cramming as many skills as I could but it was not clear what Deku should do and it was a bit messy trying to incorporate everything. Now he still has that feel of a lot of skills but he has a clearer gameplan in both his Modes and they should interact with each other in a cool way. Furthermore, I was able to still incorporate all his quirks in here, you'll see Fa Jin, even Danger Sense and Float like before but in more balanced forms. There's also gearshift but it's more flavour with the pretense of how skills get enhanced.

- Next update(s)
    -  New Skills - New Mode (?Quirk Combo Mode?)
    -  Balance changes
    -  Bug fixes
    -  Improved Animations and Effects
    -  Better Sound Effects

## Known Issues 


## Overview
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a40c5209-94aa-44c7-a371-545263d5c065)

- Deku's game plan depends on which Mode he is in:
- Might mode focuses on getting into an enemy's face and dealing high damage. FaJin provides both offense and defense through it's damage boost and barrier gain, and working towards a high-uptime allows Deku to stay in the fight for a longer. 
- Shoot Style mode focuses on mobility, evasion and range. With the combo debuff from Shoot Style Smash, it enables deku to lower his cooldowns, allowing for a fast-paced style of play.
- Deku gains Enhanced and Mastered versions of all his skills at levels 10 and 20 respectively, these offer numerical changes but also functional changes as well depending on the skill.
- In any mode, Deku has access to Blackwhip, enabling him to grapple onto walls or enemies and swing. Deku can move based on his directional inputs and his aim direction.
