## Known Issues
<p> Jelly head in game happens sometimes- fixed by exiting/dying then picking the character again. Not sure why it happens, will aim to add more ragdoll bones to fix it.
<br> 

## Overview
Deku's general game plan is that his base form is safe with range and crowd control but with low damage. Then, when needed, he can use his special (OFA 100%) to increase his damage output and mobility. When at low health he can rely on his passive increased regen in base form to heal up.
Attack speed scales fairly well with him as most skills do scale with it. Aiming to mitigate the health drain costs in OFA 100% mode can also make him very powerful.

## Skills
