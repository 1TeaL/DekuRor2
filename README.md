## Latest Changelog, Next update(s)
- 5.0.4- Fixes/Changes
    - Fixed Float Sense grounded version not working.
    - Made it so Shoot Style Smash can't animation cancel itself, either the animation has to finish or Deku can use Float Sense to cancel.
- 5.0.3- Fixes
    - Made sure Delaware only did 1 instance of damage
    - Fixed Detroit Smash Special Forward from making Deku invincible after using it.
    - Fixed calculations for health costs for Deku's supers. Previously was only doing the 10% health cost (aka as if only 1 bar was missing).	
- 5.0.2- Fixes
    - Made sure to check if risk of options is installed as it isn't a hard dependency
- 5.0.1- Fixes
    - Delaware smash release animation now plays
- 5.0.0- Deku Final Form Rework! SOTS Patch!
- Changes/Rework
    - Most if not all skills have been reworked and changed
    - Plus Ultra meter has been reworked:
    	- Deku now gains it at a set rate and when attacking enemies, the rate is doubled
     	- It is now split into 3 bars, and Deku's specials cost 1, 2 or 3 bars based on a neutral, backward or forward directional input.
      	- If Deku does not have enough bars, he can still use the special at an exponentially increasing cost of health for each missing bar. (10%, 30%, 60%)
        - When Deku switches modes, if he has atleast 1 bar, he will spend it for a Mode Switch attack with additional bonuses.
      	- Deku still can Go Beyond! when at max meter and takes a fatal hit.
    - Deku no longer has his old One For All special. Instead, at levels 10 and 20 he gains enhanced and mastered versions of his skills indicating his mastery over OFA. 
    - The overall aim of this rework is to streamline some of his clunkyness with the OFA special switching. It also aims to give deku a more coherent moveset, previously it was all about just cramming as many skills as I could but it was not clear what Deku should do and it was a bit messy trying to incorporate everything. Now he still has that feel of a lot of skills but he has a clearer gameplan in both his Modes and they should interact with each other in a cool way. Furthermore, I was able to still incorporate all his quirks in here, you'll see Fa Jin, even Danger Sense and Float like before but in more balanced forms. There's also gearshift but it's more flavour with the pretense of how skills get enhanced.

- Next update(s)
    -  New Skills - New Mode (?Quirk Combo Mode?)
    -  Balance changes
    -  Bug fixes
    -  Improved Animations and Effects
    -  Better Sound Effects

## Known Issues 


## Overview
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a40c5209-94aa-44c7-a371-545263d5c065)

- Deku's game plan depends on which Mode he is in:
- Might mode focuses on getting into an enemy's face and dealing high damage. FaJin provides both offense and defense through it's damage boost and barrier gain, and working towards a high-uptime allows Deku to stay in the fight for a longer. 
- Shoot Style mode focuses on mobility, evasion and range. With the combo debuff from Shoot Style Smash, it enables deku to lower his cooldowns, allowing for a fast-paced style of play.
- Deku gains Enhanced and Mastered versions of all his skills at levels 10 and 20 respectively, these offer numerical changes but also functional changes as well depending on the skill.
- In any mode, Deku has access to Blackwhip, enabling him to grapple onto walls or enemies and swing. Deku can move based on his directional inputs and his aim direction.

<summary>Click to expand previous patch notes:</summary>

    - Changed all quirk skills to cost 5 instead to reduce the price for toggling a skill off.
    - Fixed Float not giving the float buff 
    - Shoot Style Kick 100%- no longer scales duration by attackspeed as you could just travel no where without movespeed. Attackspeed now increases damage instead.
    - Fixed Blackwhip not attaching to enemies and dealing damage/healing. It also now adds 10 seconds to it's duration each time you activate it. 
    - Fixed Blackwhip 45% not travelling to walls.
    - Fixed Manchester 45% duration not being reduced further and further after each use.
- 4.1.1- Bug fixes/Skill changes
    - Improved priority of OFA skills so it can be used on top of other skills a bit better
    - Wind effect for Detroit Smash 45% and 100% was using Smokescreen's purple particle- changed back to white.  
    - Float- no longer limits the height gain even when you jump- particularly double jump.
    - Improved Detroit 1,000,000% and Final Smash code for less issues- attack speed also instead scales the damage only rather than increasing the number of ticks before the final hit.
    - Improved Manchester Smash and Manchester Smash 45% damage radius 
- 4.1.0- Loadout REWORK and Skill Changes
    - Loadout REWORK
    	- Added all skills to be chosen on loadout. This is to enable more flexibility for Deku. 
    	- All mode specials are available on Extra skill slots 1,2 and 3.
    	- 2 New skills added on Extra skill slot 4- Cycle mode and Type Mode:
    		- Cycle mode cycles the skills in the order of Fist->Shoot Style->Quirk->Fist etc.
    		- Type mode cycle skills to another skill of the same type. 	 
		- Old skills will still be available as well.
    - Skill Changes
    	- Blackwhip 45% effect change- now you have a line tether to the enemy change. 
    	- Blackwhip 45% can now also attach to the terrain and you will travel towards it.
    	- Blackwhip 100% will also tether to the 'Target' for 20 seconds. While tethered, if the target were to go further than 30m away from you, they will be pulled towards you.
    	- Blackwhip 100%'s original effect of pulling enemies towards you is still there, and this effect will activate when the current enemy is too far away as well, pulling multiple people along with them.
    	- Blackwhip 100% will now last forever until reactivation, but drain energy constantly.
    	- Gear shift and Gear shift 45% will now last forever until reactivation, but drain energy constantly.
    	- Float has limited height gain after 3 seconds.
    	- Fa Jin has a new visual effect to match the Anime. Fa Jin also gives 1.5x movespeed too.
- 4.0.5 - Balance changes/bug fixes
    - Fixed Ancient scepter with Deku as it was including the old Extra Quirks skill.
    - Changing modes no longer cost plus ultra as it was a bit limiting, especially with using extra quirks as they already costed plus ultra. Also, they no longer refresh cooldowns when you switch- the cost before was to limit people refreshing cooldowns, now, similar to using OFA, an internal timer is checked based on how long you are in a specific mode, and cooldowns are reduced based on that. 
    - Most Shoot Style attacks now scale with movespeed.
    - Fixed math behind Shoot Style kick 45%, before was doing little damage.
    - Manchester Smash 45% is now faster, jumping and landing before both took 1 seconds -> 0.7 seconds each.
    - Fixed stunning attacks not applying the barrier mark.
    - Swapped Manchester Smash and St Louis Smash skill slots- previously manchester was a secondary, made it utility but felt more apt for it to fit on the secondary slot.
    - Reworked/reverted Manchester Smash 45% to the original jump up and slam down, but now dealing damage on the jump and slam as well. This is to push shoot style more into that lower damage but more hits style.
    - Buffed Manchester Smash 100% damage from 600% -> 3x400%, similarly having more hits thus more procs.
    - Nerfed movespeed scaling on Shoot Style Kick 45%- was doing way too much damage.
    - Changed the barrier gain on barrier mark from 10% of damage dealt -> 1% of max health.
    - Made 1,000,000% detroit delaware smash and final smash not affect the teleport bosses. Also noted known issue that they can bug out, causing deku to be stuck in animation for longer than normal.
- 4.0.4 - Bug fixes/balance changes

- 4.0.1 - Fixed on-hit effects not working.
- 4.0.0 - *THE DEKU REWORK!*    
    - *NEW*

        - One for all 45% and 100%no longer give increased damage and attack speed, just increased armor and movespeed.
    	    - Removed OFA 100%s negative health regen, now it's self-damage instead, allowing more mitigation options. 
    	- Changed health from 150 + 30 per level to 144 + 19 per level 
	
- 3.2.0
    - Fixed animation timings with attacks to properly scale with attackspeed.
    - Removed OFA 45% and 100% as they are basically irrelevant.

    - Adjusted sound balance, fixed bug that made ditto play an unused deku voice line.

         - St Louis Smash secondary now heals based on a portion of your max hp, scaling with attack speed, to give it a niche of its own compared to the other secondary

- rest of changelog on github

        - Adjusted barrier gain for manchester and blackwhip to % of max health instead of base damage. (This is an overall nerf)
        - Slight Fa jin rework- I've found that running around to build up the Fa jin stacks is not the best, for now:
             - Increased max buff count to 200 
             - Fa Jin primary grants 25 stacks (ancient scepter gives 50)
             - All skills grant 10 stacks
             - Stacks are only consumed when there are 50 stacks

    -  New Skills!
        - Primary skill- Danger Sense. Activate danger sense, the next attack will be dodged and the attacker will take damage. If timed properly, hit enemies around you as well.
        - Secondary skill- St louis smash airforce. Kick ranged blasts of air pressure in front of you (St louis 45% instead will be just in front of you, 100% has range again).
        - Utility Skill changes- Shoot Style (utility 1) and Shoot Style Full Cowling (utility 2)
             - Shoot Style has been changed to Float- a skill that sends you up, disabling gravity and changing your
 special to Delaware Smash. Deactivate the skill by pressing the button again. 
             - Shoot Style Full Cowling has been changed to Oklahoma Smash- while holding the skill, knockback enemies around you and have increased armor at the cost of slower movespeed.
- 2.2.0

    -  updated to void patch
- 2.1.0

    -  Balanced Shoot Style Kick 100%
          -  I inadvertently buffed shoot style kick last patch, it was because I forgot to actually make the damage fo the move scale by movespeed. 
          -  This resulted in the current patch move to be a lot stronger, and with 100% freezing and hitting twice (basically double damage), it was nuts. 
          -  Also, freezing constantly is nuts and makes mithrix a free win, so instead I'm gonna make it such that every 4 hits, (3 if you hit on that 4th one) it will freeze. 
          -  I've also lowered the damage from 2x300% to 2x100%- it's still strong but less so.
- 2.0.0

    -  Added another new alt special - One For All, this skill cycles Deku between OFA base, 45% and 100%. Depending on what base skills you choose, they will be upgraded accordingly. (This was my initial plan with Deku but had no idea, well now I do, and I'll still keep OFA 45% and OFA 100% as alternate skill options.)
    -  Added lightning effects to Deku's eyes when using OFA 100% to differentiate it from the 45% lightning.
    -  Updated Character select font colours.
    -  Renamed skills because of this update.
          -  The boosted 100% primary st louis smash 100% -> shoot style full cowling 100%. Should have happened a long time ago, the moves are exactly the same mechanically, and st louis smash 45% is also a different move. Although, the 100% version of shoot style full cowling through OFA Cycle will be different as the same values for a primary on a utility won't work. 
    -  Cleaned up code with skills.
          -  Fixed blackwhip 45% to properly use its numbers, it was using base blackwhips.
          -  Smokescreen now properly makes allies invisible if you're not the host.
          -  Fixed shoot style utility to use its numbers as well instead of using mercenary's eviscerate numbers.
          -  Made OFA 100% buffs take into account barrier now, so you won't die due to negative regen if you have barrier but low HP.
    -  Balanced skills.
          -  Adjusted skill cooldowns.
          -  Buffed blackwhip combo to 400% damage, added extra attacks when its Fajin Boosted too.
          -  Changed Shoot Style to now deal 100% per hit (not that it was hitting for the damage I set before), the duration has been adjust to 1 second, and the fajin buffed version has been buffed.
          -  Buffed blackwhip (and fajin buffed version) and blackwhip 45% damage, 45% also grants barrier now.
          -  The boosted 100% primary (shoot style full cowling 100%) now has deku take 1% of his health when using it, as the regen buffs are more lenient.
    -  Improved Fa Jin Buffed skills.
          -  Blackwhip and blackwhip combo buff as mentioned.
          -  Shoot style utility allows you to hold the button down to increase the duration, up to (10 seconds), now properly doubles duration and hits as well.
          -  Shoot style kick primary causes an extra AOE attack with the same damage properties, this should help with having the skill kill any frozen enemies instead of using a different skill.  
    -  Skills Added.
          -  Airforce 100%
          -  Shoot style kick 45%
          -  Shoot style kick 100%
          -  Blackwhip 100%
          -  Manchester 45%
          -  Manchester 100%
          -  Shoot Style 45%
          -  Shoot Style 100%
          -  Shoot Style Full Cowling 45%
          -  Shoot Style Full Cowling 100%
          -  Detroit Smash 45%

- 1.4.0

    -  Added another new alt special - Deku's extra quirks. This comes with new functionality for all skills.
    -  Rebalanced of OFA 100%- regen is now only -4x, and passive regen works, this means that at some point your HP will actually regen back.
    -  Nerfed Detroit Smash 100% charging damage since its easier to charge for a longer time, but the initial damage is still the same.
- 1.3.4

    -  Accidentally increased damage multiplier for OFA 100%(2 to 2.5x): was testing ways to maybe buff OFA 100% but not set yet.
    -  Lowered the volume of Deku's voice and lowered their chance of playing as well so he doesn't speak everytime.

- 1.3.3 

     - Lowered CD of manchester to 4 seconds (thought 5 was too long).
     - Networked manchester smash so no more self-damage if you were not the host. 
	- networked OFA 45% so you can get the buff (don't know how I fixed these). 
	- Fixed ragdoll by adding a bunch of exclusions to the dynamic bone script. 
	- Improved suck code for blackwhip and now works in multiplayer if you are not the host. 
                 - blackwhip and blackwhip 45% rework and rebalance- they now hit multiple times (5x).
	- Rebalanced Airforce 45% to have greater damage to 150% per bullet but harsher fall-off to further push 45%'s lower range and mobility.
    - Added Passive to be seen in the loadout now! Also made the sprinting in all directions in built into Deku passively without using a skill. 
    - ALSO new particles for airforce(s), blackwhip(s), detroit(s), delaware! LMK any thoughts about them.
- 1.3.2 
	- Properly credited model maker. 
	- Made most of his skills to make Deku enter sprinting- since most moves scale of movespeed this buffs them by default and rather than sprinting beforehand. 
	- Fixed descriptions for skills. 
	- Fixed regen code for OFA 45% so that it is always 0. 
	- Buffed OFA 100% so that at the negative regen won't kill you (also- this was previously in but the health costs of his moves could never kill Deku in the first place either) and lowered the negative regen multiplier to x-7. 
	- Buffed boosted 100% primary by removing the health cost as that was too debilitating. 
	- Halved duration of invincibility with Shoot Style Kick primary and OFA 100% St Louis primary (since it doesnt cost health). 
		- Made the damage hitbox of shoot style kick larger to fix the occasions where the hitbox didn't hurt enemies. 
		- Also adjusted the bouncing of shoot style kick, it was not consistent before. 
	- Buffed shoot style dash to have greater range. 
	- Improved code for shoot style so that it doesn't get cancelled by other attacks. 
	- Set the range of detroit smash (weak version)to be static so that it doesn't grant crazy range but now scales better with movespeed and also scales with attackspeed. 
	- Nerfed Airforce 45% to be more in line with other 45% skills (made the damage by 80% as when taken into account the damage multiplier for 45% it will be 120% per bullet, before it was 150% per bullet basically and with 5 bullets it was nuts) and also properly made it have 4 bullets instead of 5. 
	- Updated Overview page. 
	- Improved code for St Louis 45% so that it puts you in the spot when using it and decreased the duration as well. Improved the radius and made position range of Blackwhip 45% further. Improved ragdoll by having the camera follow Deku as he dies. Also forgot to update the mod version in the code.
- 1.3.1 
	- Buffed alternate primary (damage scales by movespeed, gain invincibility during use as well), fixed some naming issues and fixed secondary blackwhip not being the right skill. 
- 1.3.0 
	- Changed formula for OFA 100% special such that getting regen items won't negatively affect the skills. 
	- Added alt primary shoot style kick, alt secondary manchester smash, alt utility detroit smash, alt special OFA 45%. 
	- renamed boosted 100% skills by adding 100% to them to separate the differences between the detroit smashes. 
	- Corrected some readme errors- boosted primary invincibility duration should scale down, not remain the same. 
	- Removed walking animation and used sprinting animation for it as well- just thought it didn't look right. 
	- Some balance changes such as making the cooldown of 100% boosted primary st louis smash none again.
- 1.2.0 
	- Fixed ancient scepter support with proper 10% lifesteal. 
	- Adjusted boosted primary (added self-damage and changed the speed and duration scaling). Buffed regen passive to accommodate the higher self-damage. Added new Alt skill (Similar to boosted primary, weaker but with stun). Fixed descriptions for skills. Changed colours to descriptions. Added ragdoll. Updated Readme.
- 1.1.1 
	- fixed model issues, code clean up. (Forgot to mention previously) Changed effect of boosted primary as it may have been causing memory leaks. Changed menu colour to green. Lowered volume of voice and sfx, changed sfx of primary.
- 1.1.0 
	- added Ancient Scepter support.
- 1.0.1 
	- removed r2modman from dependencies.
- 1.0.0 
	- released
