# DekuRor2
Deku mod for Ror2
Go beyond

## Deku
Adds Deku from My Hero Academia, a high risk survivor which can boost his stats and skills, in exchange for health regen and even health costs for his skills. 
#### Multiplayer works (hopefully). Standalone Ancient Scepter support.
#### Message me on the Risk of Rain 2 Modding Discord if there are any issues- TeaL#5571.

## Known Issues
</p> Pulling enemies with blackwhip is based on heaviest enemy so lighter enemies will be sent flying.
<br> Pulling enemies with blackwhip combo is fixed so some enemies will be pulled more than others.
<br> Player who are not the host won't make others invisible with Fa Jin boosted smokescreen.

## Overview
    Deku's general game plan is that his base form is safe with range and crowd control but with low damage. 
    Then, when needed, he can use his specials (OFA 100% and 45%) to increase his damage and/or mobility. 
    OFA 100% focuses on close range but greater mobility while OFA 45% focuses on mid-range attacks.
    When at low health he can rely on his passive increased regen in base form to heal up.
    Attack speed and Movespeed scales fairly well with him as most skills do scale with it.
    Aiming to mitigate the health drain costs in OFA 100% mode can also make him very powerful.
    OFA 45% instead only allows direct healing effects rather than health regen but in turn doesn't drain health.
    OFA Quirks grants Deku new functionality for all his base skills with the new Fa Jin Buff.

## Changelog
- 1.4.0

    -  Added another new alt special - Deku's extra quirks. This comes with new functionality for all skills.
    -  Rebalanced of OFA 100%- regen is now only -4x, and passive regen works, this means that at some point your HP will actually regen back.
    -  Nerfed Detroit Smash 100% charging damage since its easier to charge for a longer time, but the initial damage is still the same.
- 1.3.4

    -  Accidentally increased damage multiplier for OFA 100%(2 to 2.5x): was testing ways to maybe buff OFA 100% but not set yet.
    -  Lowered the volume of Deku's voice and lowered their chance of playing as well so he doesn't speak everytime.

- 1.3.3 

     - Lowered CD of manchester to 4 seconds (thought 5 was too long).
     - Networked manchester smash so no more self-damage if you were not the host. 
	- networked OFA 45% so you can get the buff (don't know how I fixed these). 
	- Fixed ragdoll by adding a bunch of exclusions to the dynamic bone script. 
	- Improved suck code for blackwhip and now works in multiplayer if you are not the host. 
                 - blackwhip and blackwhip 45% rework and rebalance- they now hit multiple times (5x).
	- Rebalanced Airforce 45% to have greater damage to 150% per bullet but harsher fall-off to further push 45%'s lower range and mobility.
    - Added Passive to be seen in the loadout now! Also made the sprinting in all directions in built into Deku passively without using a skill. 
    - ALSO new particles for airforce(s), blackwhip(s), detroit(s), delaware! LMK any thoughts about them.
- 1.3.2 
	- Properly credited model maker. 
	- Made most of his skills to make Deku enter sprinting- since most moves scale of movespeed this buffs them by default and rather than sprinting beforehand. 
	- Fixed descriptions for skills. 
	- Fixed regen code for OFA 45% so that it is always 0. 
	- Buffed OFA 100% so that at the negative regen won't kill you (also- this was previously in but the health costs of his moves could never kill Deku in the first place either) and lowered the negative regen multiplier to x-7. 
	- Buffed boosted 100% primary by removing the health cost as that was too debilitating. 
	- Halved duration of invincibility with Shoot Style Kick primary and OFA 100% St Louis primary (since it doesnt cost health). 
		- Made the damage hitbox of shoot style kick larger to fix the occasions where the hitbox didn't hurt enemies. 
		- Also adjusted the bouncing of shoot style kick, it was not consistent before. 
	- Buffed shoot style dash to have greater range. 
	- Improved code for shoot style so that it doesn't get cancelled by other attacks. 
	- Set the range of detroit smash (weak version)to be static so that it doesn't grant crazy range but now scales better with movespeed and also scales with attackspeed. 
	- Nerfed Airforce 45% to be more in line with other 45% skills (made the damage by 80% as when taken into account the damage multiplier for 45% it will be 120% per bullet, before it was 150% per bullet basically and with 5 bullets it was nuts) and also properly made it have 4 bullets instead of 5. 
	- Updated Overview page. 
	- Improved code for St Louis 45% so that it puts you in the spot when using it and decreased the duration as well. Improved the radius and made position range of Blackwhip 45% further. Improved ragdoll by having the camera follow Deku as he dies. Also forgot to update the mod version in the code.
- 1.3.1 
	- Buffed alternate primary (damage scales by movespeed, gain invincibility during use as well), fixed some naming issues and fixed secondary blackwhip not being the right skill. 
- 1.3.0 
	- Changed formula for OFA 100% special such that getting regen items won't negatively affect the skills. 
	- Added alt primary shoot style kick, alt secondary manchester smash, alt utility detroit smash, alt special OFA 45%. 
	- renamed boosted 100% skills by adding 100% to them to separate the differences between the detroit smashes. 
	- Corrected some readme errors- boosted primary invincibility duration should scale down, not remain the same. 
	- Removed walking animation and used sprinting animation for it as well- just thought it didn't look right. 
	- Some balance changes such as making the cooldown of 100% boosted primary st louis smash none again.
- 1.2.0 
	- Fixed ancient scepter support with proper 10% lifesteal. 
	- Adjusted boosted primary (added self-damage and changed the speed and duration scaling). Buffed regen passive to accommodate the higher self-damage. Added new Alt skill (Similar to boosted primary, weaker but with stun). Fixed descriptions for skills. Changed colours to descriptions. Added ragdoll. Updated Readme.
- 1.1.1 
	- fixed model issues, code clean up. (Forgot to mention previously) Changed effect of boosted primary as it may have been causing memory leaks. Changed menu colour to green. Lowered volume of voice and sfx, changed sfx of primary.
- 1.1.0 
	- added Ancient Scepter support.
- 1.0.1 
	- removed r2modman from dependencies.
- 1.0.0 
	- released

## Future plans
##### Currently he's just using the effects from RoR2. 
##### Better animations (I animated them myself and they are not great- TCoolDzn is helping me big thanks to him!).
##### Still more Alt skills (tried to use loader hook code for blackwhip and..yea, similarly might try to implement artificer's hover for float).
##### Code clean-up (lots of leftover code that I commented out).
##### Alt skins
